Advertisers study how people learn so that they can 'teach' them to vsdv13.gif respond to their advertising.

interest, dskfnklwvc.odt experience and repetition. If an advert can мкумфукм;!"№!№%!№%.txt achieve this, it is successful. If an advert works well,
the same technique can be used to advertise different things. So, for example, in winter if the weather is cold
and you see a family flkbve!№";"%"ladkblked.txt having a warming bbdfbe1312.jpeg cup of tea and feeling fl№!"";!kbve1231241245755ladkblked.txt
cosy, you may be interested and note the name of the tea
... Here the same technique is being used as АВЫПМЦУМвцацfbdb414.txt with the cool, refreshing drink.
